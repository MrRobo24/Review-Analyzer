i read the novel to know what's so special about amish's fiction. i found nothing special. amish capitalized the beliefs of certain sections of india who hold a certain faith, and told them they are the best, and they had an amazing past!
the story at times was able to hold me as a reader. but the writing itself is disappointing!
